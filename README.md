## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, world! My name is Robotshell, and I am a passionate hacker with several years of experience in the field. I work as a Cybersecurity Auditor & Penetration Tester, and I am also a specialist teacher in Cybersecurity. I have had the opportunity to share my knowledge through cybersecurity conferences. I am actively involved in the hacking community, contributing through reporting CVEs, exploits, creating tools, and many other stuff. I also participate in Bug Bounty programs, where I find vulnerabilities and help secure various platforms. Feel free to explore my stuff and connect with me. Happy hacking!
